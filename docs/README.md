## Documentation Structure

Our documentation is organized into several key sections:

1. **Getting Started**: Essential guides to help you begin using the Feature Store
2. **Core Documentation**: Detailed technical documentation about the system
3. **Examples and Tutorials**: Practical examples and guides
4. **Additional Resources**: Project information and contribution guidelines

## Key Concepts

### What is a Feature Store?

A Feature Store is a centralized repository for storing and managing machine learning features. It solves several critical challenges in ML systems:

1. **Feature Consistency**
   - Same transformations in training and inference
   - Prevents feature drift
   - Maintains consistency across models

2. **Feature Reuse**
   - Share features between teams
   - Reduce duplicate work
   - Promote collaboration

3. **Feature Governance**
   - Version tracking
   - Data lineage
   - Compliance and auditing

### FStore Architecture

FStore uses a modern architecture with multiple components:

1. **Processing Layer (Apache Spark)**
   - Distributed feature processing
   - Stream processing with Kafka
   - SQL transformations
   - JDBC integration with PostgreSQL

2. **Storage Layer**
   - **Online Store (Redis)**
     - Fast feature serving
     - Real-time feature updates
     - Feature caching
   
   - **Offline Store (PostgreSQL)**
     - Processed feature storage
     - Historical feature values
     - SQL query support
   
   - **Metadata Store (MongoDB)**
     - Feature definitions
     - Configuration management
     - Version tracking

3. **API Layer (FastAPI)**
   - REST endpoints
   - Feature management
   - Real-time serving
   - Monitoring

### Feature Processing Flow

1. **Event Ingestion**
   ```mermaid
   sequenceDiagram
       Client->>Kafka: Send Feature Event
       Kafka->>Spark: Stream Event
       Spark->>PostgreSQL: Store Processed Features
       PostgreSQL-->>Client: Features Available
   ```

2. **Feature Serving**
   ```mermaid
   sequenceDiagram
       Client->>API: Request Features
       API->>Redis: Check Cache
       Redis-->>API: Cache Miss
       API->>PostgreSQL: Fetch Features
       PostgreSQL-->>API: Return Features
       API->>Redis: Update Cache
       API-->>Client: Return Features
   ```
